## Industrial Technology Research Institute  
*Service Robot Department, Intelligent Robotics Technology Division, Mechnical and Mechatronics System Research Labs*  
*Robotic Intern, Jul. 2020 - Jan. 2021*  
* Implement a ros driver program from scratch for controlling our skid-steering robot.  
* Launched a skid-steering outdoor mobile robot with reliable hub motors and motor drivers.      
* Accomplished a ROS package that allowed the wheeled robot to navigate the environment.  
* [Steering Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NyFRt79YzM3azaviLcz2Dt8Tn5gh6NSv/view?usp=sharing)
