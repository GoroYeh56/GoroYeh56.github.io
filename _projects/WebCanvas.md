This is a assignment 1 of Software Studio.
I accomplished a web canvas application where people can
enjoy themselves being the greatest artist in their mind
and draw whatever please them on the web application.

I accomplished the website using HTML, CSS, and javaScript.

You can **upload image** from your local computer or **download the masterpiece**
you draw on the web canvas.
You can also **undo** the changes you make, or **redo** if you accidentally undo it.

I also implemented **music selection** for users who enjoy listening to beautiful music.
