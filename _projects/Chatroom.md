This is a midterm project of Software Studio.
I accomplished a private web chatroom application where people can
sign up their accounts and chat with others in private chatroom.

I accomplished the website using HTML, CSS, and javaScript.

For the database system, I use the **firebase** service.

I even create **Personal Page** system for people to post their daily 
lives on the website to share with the public.

I also implemented **notification** mechanism for users.

For more details, refer to the link below.
