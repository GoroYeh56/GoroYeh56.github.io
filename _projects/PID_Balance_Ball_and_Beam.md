This is the final project of Logic Design Laboratory.
I established a **Self-Balancing Beam and Ball** system which can maintain the ball at 
any specified location under disturbance and noise with error < 1cm.

I implemented the PID control algorithm using Verilog description language in a FPGA board.
For the sensor, I used an infrared distance sensor.
For the actuator, I picked the high-torque output servo motor MG995.
