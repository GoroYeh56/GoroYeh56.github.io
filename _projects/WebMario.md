This is a assignment 2 of Software Studio.
I accomplished a web **mario** game.
People can sign up an account, and play the mario-like game.

There're multi-levels to play and different types of enemies.

There's also a scoreboard which encourage the players to win higher scores.

I accomplished the website using **Cocos Creator engine** and **typescript**.
