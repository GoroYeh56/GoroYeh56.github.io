## Demo 01 - Motion Control with Odometry Localization

This task is to control the robot to move to the specify points with correct orientations.  
The robot localizes itself using **odometry**.

## Demo 02 - Navigation using vSLAM with D435 depth camera

**Notes:** The robot navigates the environment using vSLAM with depth camera Intel Realsense D435, **NOT simply follows the line!!** (The line is for human to verify the precision of the robot performance, it's for grading.)

## Final Contest - Object Classification and Recycling
* First Stage: Motion Control from starting point to goal location  
* Second Stage: Classify objects' colors and location using D435 camera  
* Third Stage: Grab the object and place it to its corresponding bin using LoCoBot manipulator.
