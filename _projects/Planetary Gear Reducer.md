This is a final project of Mechanical Design .
We desgined and constructed a **Planetary Gear Reducer** of a racing car.
We analyzed the parameters of each parts of the assembly under the given specifications,
and I'm responsible for accomplished the whole simulation model using AutoCAD Inventor.

I drew most of the CAD and engineering drawings, and simulated the performance and reliability of the assembly.
