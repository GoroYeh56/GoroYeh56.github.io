## Report url: [Planetary Gear Reducer Final Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-X0-GxfcLa7BiPdFTz5ZzCKahNzYmHvc/view?usp=sharing)
This is a final project of Mechanical Design .
We desgined and constructed a **Planetary Gear Reducer** of a racing car.
We analyzed the parameters of each parts of the assembly under the given specifications,
and I'm responsible for accomplished the whole simulation model using AutoCAD Inventor.

I drew most of the CAD and engineering drawings, and simulated the performance and reliability of the assembly.
